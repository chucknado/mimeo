# Mimeo

Create and sync copies of articles in Help Center by Zendesk Guide.


## Overview

You can publish copies of any article in one or more specified sections in your Help Center, or in any branded Help Center in your Guide Professional plan. You can then sync the content of your source articles with their copies to keep the copies up-to-date.

Here's the general workflow:

1. Publish an article in Help Center.
2. In the **loader.json** file, identify the source article and specify the locations in Help Center where you want to make copies of it.
3. Run **replicate.py** to make copies of the article based on the information in the loader file.
4. Periodically run **sync.py** to sync the content of source articles with their copies.
5. To remove one or more copies of an article, identify the copies in **unloader.json** and run **unreplicate.py**.

The first step is to set up Mimeo on your computer. See [Setting up Mimeo](https://github.com/chucknado/mimeo/tree/master/docs/setup.md).

## Limitations, or "improvement opportunities""

The tool has the following limitations. Feel free to clone the project and build your own solutions to them.

- No UI yet! You must manually edit a JSON file to specify articles and their copies, then run a script at the command line.

- The tool doesn't support replicating article attachments.

- The tool doesn't support replicating article translations.
